# Starting position: Cases ICON & LiGen

<div class=column>
    
ICON

- Rewrite of earlier weather model in early 2000s
- Next generation modeling system capable of global simulations down to 1km resolutions
- Operational forecasts since 2015
- GPU porting started in ~2015

</div>

<div class=column>
    
LiGen

- Existing code with basic features mostly working
- Bad scaling paradigm
- Complete rewrite of the application to use advanced C++ features
    - Data flow design
    - GPU acceleration added
</div>


# Design model

- Development is not only about physics and numerics
    - Also about **how** you do it
- Instead of "Just code" it is advantageous to plan a little too!
    - Also think about future possible extensions!
- Software engineering has come up with lots of different development models
    - Waterfall, V-model, Agile models (Scrum etc.), ...
    - Also scientific software may benefit from formal development models

# Design considerations

- Parallelization strategies
- Data design
- Programming languages
- Modularity
- I/O formats
- Documenatation
- Testing


# Parallelization strategies

- Planning includes thinking what is the target platform
- Target machines: laptops, small clusters, supercomputers
    - OpenMP, MPI, MPI+OpenMP, GPUs
- From shared memory to distributed memory machines
    - Keep in mind that most machines are distributed memory systems = MPI
- Moving from <1000 cores to >10k cores
    - Parallellization strategies need to be considered
    - Non-blocking, avoiding global calls,...
- Accelerators
    - GPUs have their own tricks and quirks

# Parallelization strategies 

- Going **BIG** -> GPUs are mandatory
- But not all HPC needs to be exascale
    - Size is not a goal in itself

# Case ICON: Parallellization

<div class=column style="width:65%">
- Domain decomposition of the horizontal grid
- Halo exchange with `Isend` / `Irecv`
- Asynchronous I/O with special I/O processes
    - One sided MPI
- Coupled simulations
    - Some processes simulate atmosphere, some ocean at the same time
- Good parallel scalability
</div>

# Case ICON: GPU porting

- Most of the computations on GPU
- Data copied to the GPU in the start of the simulation
- Loops parallelized with OpenACC directives
    - Few CUDA/HIP kernels
- GPU aware MPI communication

# Case LiGen: Parallellization

<div class=column style="width:58%">
    
- Embarassingly parallel (or data parallel)
- One process per node
- Internal pipeline
    - Thread balancing is a variable to explore!
        - Find the bottleneck, increase workers, repeat

- No need to communicate between nodes
    - MPI used only for I/O operations

</div>

# Case LiGen: GPU parallelization

<div class=column style="width:55%">
- Traditional approach: distribute computation
    - Latency oriented: process a single data as fast as possible

- New solution: batch of data
    - Throughput oriented: kernel is slower, but can handle much more data
    - If enough data are available, throughput is increased
    - Possible only if amount of memory per data required is small

# Programming languages

- Selection of languages
    - Performance oriented languages (low level)
    - Programmability oriented languages (high level)
    - Mix
        - Best of both worlds
        - Low-level languages for costly functions
        - High-level languages for main functions

# Low level languages

- Direct control over memory
- Most common are C, C++, Fortran
    - Better support for GPU programming in C/C++, HIP does not support Fortran  kernels

<div class=column>

- C++
    - std library for data structures
    - low level memory management (concept of data ownership, move semantics,...)
    - metaprogramming

</div>

<div class=column>

- Fortran
    - Good for number crunching
    - Good array syntax
    - Language semantics make optimization easier for compilers

</div>

# High level languages

- Python/Julia
    - Faster coding cycle and less error prone
    - Testing, debugging, and prototyping much easier
    - Built on top of high performance libraries (numpy, tensorflow,...)

- Combinations/suggestions
    - Python & C++ (PyBind11) for object-oriented programming
    - Julia & Fortran (native) for functional programming

# GPU programming approaches

- Directive based approaches: OpenACC and OpenMP
    - "standard" and "portable"
- Native low level languages: CUDA (NVIDIA) and HIP (AMD)
    - HIP supports in principle also NVIDIA devices
    - With HIP, Fortran needs wrappers via C-bindings
- Performance portability frameworks: SYCL, Kokkos
    - Support only C++
- Standard language features: parallel C++, `do concurrent`
    - Rely on implicit data movements
    - Compiler support incomplete

# Modular code design: programming

- Good code is modular
    - Encapsulation 
    - Self-contained functions
    - No global variables, input what you need
- Modular code takes more time to design but is **a lot** easier to extend and understand

# Case LiGen: Modular design

- Pipeline of stages with a common structure (input/output queues)
    - Easy to create new stages to support new functionalities
- Single interface for compute intensive backends
    - High level program structure separated by time consuming accelerated code
    - Different implementation for the accelerated code.
    - Backend characteristics (e.g data movement) are hidden from the rest of the application.

# Version control

- Version control is the single most important software development tool
- Git is nowadays ubiquitous
- Additional tools in web services (github, gitlab, bitbucket)
    - Forking
    - Issue tracking
    - Review of pull/merge requests
    - wikis
- ICON and LiGen: private gitlab

# Code design: tools

<div class=column>
    
- Avoid **not invented here** syndrome
- Leverage existing software and libraries
    - Libraries
        - Numerical (BLAS, solvers,...)
        - I/O
        - Parallelization
</div>

<div class=column>
    
- Caveats:
    - Is the lib still supported/updated?
    - Do you trust the source, is it widely used
    - Is there documentation
    - Does it support all the features
</div>

# Code design: development tools

- Software development is time consuming, many tools exist to help you in the process
- Build systems automate configuring and compiling
    - CMake
    - GNU Autotools
    - Make, Ninja
- The bigger your project is, the better is to rely on these automatic tools.
    - Setup can be painful
    
# Code design: development tools

- Debuggers
- Compilers
    - Compilers are not the same, compiler bugs are real!
    - Test your code with different compilers (gnu, clang, intel, cray,...)
- Linters (check coding style)

- **Questions**: Choices in your software and experiences about them?


# Data design

- Data has to be "designed" too
- Use structures!
    - Note possible performance difference between structure of arrays vs.
      arrays of structures
- Think about the flow
- How to distribute the data 
- GPU introduce more data related problems and opportunities:
    - Memory copies between Host and Device
    - Preallocation
    - Overlapping computation with copy

# Case ICON: Data design

- Multiply nested data structures
- Need to perform deep copies for GPUs
- Fortran pointers used as "shortcuts"
- Blocking for innermost array dimension ("nproma")
    - Helps for cache performance and vectorization
    - Optimum block size very different in CPUs and GPUs (~32 vs. ~10 000)

# Case LiGen: Data design

- Relies a lot on C++ data ownership semantics (usage of move, refs, ...)
    - Avoid costly copies!

- GPU: 
    - Wrapper for memory to enable C++ RAII paradigm: we can forget about mallocs!
    - Preallocate for worst case: one malloc to process them all!
    - Double buffering

# I/O Data formats

- Data formats
    - Not just plain text files/binary files
    - Platform-independent formats (HDF5, NetCDF, ...)
    - Metadata together with the data?
- Log files
- Standard formats
    - Your field might have some data standards 
- Remember also that large simulations produce lots of data
    - Storing "big data" is an issue
    - A global climate simulation can produce one peta byte in a day

# Case ICON: I/O Data formats

- Input data (grids, initial values etc.) normally as netcdf
- Output data either in netcdf or grib2 (binary format for weather and climate data)
- Large climate simulation can produce a petabyte of data per day
    - Need to consider post-processing and long time storage

# Coding style

- Code readability comes first
- Consistency helps readability 
    - Indentation, how/when to have instructions longer than one line,...
    - Many editor have tools to help
    - There are exceptions!

# Summary 

- Software design is all about planning 
- Productivity
    - Modular design
    - Use existing libraries
    - Use & adopt design, community, and collaboration tools
    - Programming language and design selection
