# Heat equation in 2D

## Heat diffusion

Heat flows in medium according to local temperature gradient by diffusing in to
a certain equilibrium state. Such process is accurately represented with a
partial differential equation for the temperature field. In it, the
rate of change in time $t$ of the temperature field $u=u(x,y,t)$, over two
spatial dimensions $x$ and $y$, is governed by 

$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \nabla^2 u$$

where $\alpha$ is the constant heat conduction coefficient of the medium and 

$$\nabla^2 = \displaystyle\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \displaystyle\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}$$

is the Laplacian partial differential operator.

Rewriting the above equation we have
   
$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \left( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}\right).$$

This equation is well approximated by replacing the derivatives with finite
difference discretizations. This way the temperature is described only at finite
number of locations in space and time, which is desirable from the perspective of
available finite memory in modern computers.

In this mini-app we will discretize all three dimensions $x$, $y$, and
$t$, such that

$$\nabla^2 u  = \frac{u(i-1,j)-2u(i,j)+u(i+1,j)}{(\Delta x)^2}  + \frac{u(i,j-1)-2u(i,j)+u(i,j+1)}{(\Delta y)^2}$$

where $u(i,j)$ refers to the temperature at location with
integer index $i$ within the domain of $x$ spaced by $\Delta x$ and location
with integer index $j$ within the domain of $y$ spaced by $\Delta y$.

Given an initial condition ($u(t=0) = u^0$), one can follow the time
dependence of the temperature field from state $m$ to $m+1$ over
regular time steps $\Delta t$ with explicit 
time evolution method:

$$u^{m+1}(i,j) = u^m(i,j) + \Delta t \alpha \nabla^2 u^m(i,j)$$

Note: The algorithm is stable only when

$$\Delta t < \frac{1}{2 \alpha} \frac{(\Delta x \Delta y)^2}{(\Delta x)^2 (\Delta y)^2}$$

This equation expresses that the time evolution of the temperature
field at a particular location depends on the value of the field at
the previous step at the same location *and* four adjacent locations:

Heat distribution is updated from 5 cell indices (green) to the center of the cells (purple). Each cell in the grid corresponds to a $(i,j)$ -combination.
## Parallelization

The problem can be parallelized by diving the two dimensional
temperature field to different workers, i.e. doing domain
decomposition. With shared memory computers the parallelization is
relatively straightforward, however, with distributed memory
parallelization MPI some extra steps are needed.

We focus here on one dimensional decomposition. Due to different
memory layout in Fortran and C/C++, the grid is divided into blocks of columns
in Fortran or and into rows in C/C++ and each block is assigned to one
MPI task.

The MPI tasks are able to update the grid independently everywhere else than
on the boundaries -- there the communication of a single column (or row) with
the nearest neighbour is needed. This can be achieved by having additional
ghost-layers that contain the boundary data of the neighbouring tasks. As the
system is aperiodic, the outermost ranks communicate with only one neighbour,
and the inner ranks with two neighbours.


## Code

The solver carries out the time development of the 2D heat equation over the
number of time steps provided by the user. The default geometry is a flat
rectangle (with grid size provided by the user), but other shapes may be used
via input files -- a bottle is given as an example in
[common/bottle.dat](common/bottle.dat).

Examples on how to run the binary:
- `./heat`  (no arguments - the program will run with the default arguments:
             2000x2000 grid and 500 time steps)
- `./heat bottle.dat` (one argument - start from a temperature grid provided
                       in the file `bottle.dat` for the default number of time
                       steps)
- `./heat bottle.dat 1000` (two arguments - will run the program starting from
                            a temperature grid provided in the file
                            `bottle.dat` for 1000 time steps)
- `./heat 4000 8000 1000` (three arguments - will run the program in a
                           4000x8000 grid for 1000 time steps)

The program will produce an image (PNG) of the temperature field after every
500 iterations. You can change the frequency by modifying the parameter
`image_interval` in [main.c](cpp/main.cpp) (or [main.F90](fortran/main.F90)).
You can also visualize the images e.g. with the following command:
`animate heat_*.png`.
